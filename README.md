# Ducky-Discord-Token-Grabber
This script was originally made for Raspberry Pi Pico.

To start, move all the files to your ducky. (Need to encode the .dd file if not using Pico)

I did not make the python script that is included in these files. [The original is here](https://github.com/wodxgod/Discord-Token-Grabber)

To setup the script, follow step 2 in the previous link in the "How to use" section.

After that, everything should be good to go.

I haven't been able to test this on a machine that doesn't have python installed so let me know if it doesn't work.
A temporary workaround for this is the convert the python script to .exe and modify the .ps1 file to either run it from the ducky, or download it, run it, then delete it.
